twitter_filter
==============

A Javascript Twitter parser for keyword cluster search.

While I was making my food truck app, it occurred to me that it was really just a Twitter search filter-er, so I abstracted out the foodtruck-related stuff as much as I could.

Just fill in the data structure ('keyword_cluster') near the top of twitter_filter.js with a bunch of keyword clusters, and you're basically good to go.

I've included the HTML/CSS for my food truck app to serve as an example. `See it live here <http://ft.esthernam.com>`_
